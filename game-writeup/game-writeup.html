      <h2>Overivew and Usage</h2>
      <p> My project consists of an implementation of the popular snake game. For those that may not
        know this game, essentially it involves going around a certain grid and collects food to grow bigger.
        To lose the game, the user needs to move the snake into the edges of the grid or overlap the snake on itself.
        To play this game you can click the link at the top of the page. To run this code you can go to my github repo
        which is listed below and clone my snake repo. You can copy the code in both index.js and snake.html
        and put it into p5 and play the game.
      </p>

      <p> There is a bug in the game right now where once you get more than 2 of the food things and the size of the
        snake becomes 3 or larger you can not go backwards or forwards using the left or right arrow key from a
        horizontal position. I wasn't able to get to this problem in time as I knew it was with the array in that
        the head and the tail were "colliding" with the body when it would go backwards or forwards. I tried using
        the unshift() function as seen in another p5 snake game but was unable to accurately get that working. Please
        keep in mind that this bug is occurring and sorry for not fixing it in time.
      </p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <p> My step by step process consisted of: </p>
      <ol type ="1">
        <li> Look at examples of people building games in p5 </li>
        <li> Thinking about how I would create snake in p5 and looking at examples </li>
        <li> Implementing it in p5 </li>
        <li> Adding a way to keep track of the score </li>
        <li> Adding an intro screen and a way to play again </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Here is an image of an unfinished state of my website.</p>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive </h2>
      <p> One of the problems I encountered was in trying to show the score on the game. I was able to
        calculate the score in the back and keep track of it but wasn't too sure of how to display it.
        I talked with my classmate, Andy, and he directed me to the p5 resources for showing text. I
        was then able to apply the visual score in the game and that solved the issue.
      </p>

      <p> Another problem I encountered was that my html wouldn't load in the browser when I moved the
        code into a script tag in html. I was able to solve this through going to office hours with Raina
        and she helped walk me through how to go about fixing the errors I had in my console. I had forgotten
        to create the rollup.config.js as well as do npm run deploy to see if it worked on the live site. Once
        I was able to fix these issues my live site was working with the snake game.
      </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future Work </h2>
      <p> Additional ideas and features I might like to add to my site in the future: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Making my site mobile friendly and responsive</li>
        <li>Checking on accessibility sitewide</li>
        <li>Add a favicon</li>
      </ul>
