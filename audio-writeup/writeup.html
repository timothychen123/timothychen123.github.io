      <h2>Overivew and Usage</h2>
      <p> My project consists of 6 various sketches created in p5 that encompass various attributes.
        Some of these attributes are a static and random image, an interactive design, as well as an audio
        and audio/input drawing.
      </p>
      <p> My gifs and other images are presented at the top</p>
      <p>To run this code you can go to my github repo which is listed below and clone my audio-writeup repo.
        In that repo you can find a folder titled sketches in which you will find the code to each of my
        sketches. You can copy this code and run it in p5.
      </p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <p> My step by step process consisted of: </p>
      <ol type ="1">
        <li> Looking at various examples done in p5 </li>
        <li> Starting off with a concept of what I wanted to build and update across the sketches </li>
        <li> Coding each sketch and then changing it based on what I thought would look better </li>
        <li> Looking up differnet ways to incorporate audio/randomness/etc. </li>
        <li> Add researched code into p5 sketches </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Here is an image of an unfinished state of my website.</p>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive </h2>
      <p> One of the problems I encountered was adding in audio for my 5th sketch as well as responding to
        audio input for the 6th sketch. Specifically for the 5th sketch I wasn't able to figure out how to
        get audio to appear in the sketch. I was able resolve this through watching the coding train videos
        that were offered as well as looking at some of his other videos on Youtube. I also watched some
        other implementations of audio into p5 that helped me. Similarly with figuring out how to create
        a sketch that took in audio input, I looked at the p5 examples in relation to this topic as well
        as saw some other Youtube videos. </p>

      <p> Another problem I encountered was with the grid layout and image sizing. I really struggled to get
        the grid set up nicely on my portfolio webpage. I was able to resolve this through looking at Hannah's
        code examples on github as well as go to office hours and get some assistance from Raina with setting
        up a flexbox.
      </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future Work </h2>
      <p> Additional ideas and features I might like to add to my site in the future: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Making my site mobile friendly and responsive</li>
        <li>Checking on accessibility sitewide</li>
        <li>Add a favicon</li>
      </ul>
