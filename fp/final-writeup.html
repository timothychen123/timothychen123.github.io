      <h2>Overivew and Usage</h2>
      <p> My project is a drawing game similar to that of pictionary. For those that may not know this game,
        it involves choosing how much time you would like to draw the a randomly generated word and then drawing
        that word in another screen.
      <p> Here is a gif of my game.</p>

      <p>To run this code you can go to my github repo which is listed below and clone it. You can copy the
        code in the index.js, index.html, and popup.html and put it into p5 and play the game or run it locally as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <p> My step by step process consisted of: </p>
      <ol type ="1">
        <li> Taking in feedback from the showcase in 438 class </li>
        <li> Ideating on the implementation of the features such as multiple colors and choosing a time option </li>
        <li> Adding more words into the word bank </li>
        <li> Adding in the colors into p5 and checking to see if it worked </li>
        <li> Adding in different size pen sizes to use when drawing </li>
        <li> Adding in a popup to choose time options </li>
        <li> Fixing issues with selecting a time option and having it connect to the index.js file </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Here is an image of an unfinished state of my website.</p>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive </h2>
      <p> One of the problems I encountered was in adding colors and then having the color be given to the pen.
        One of the main issues I was having was getting the correct x and y coordinates of the ellipse of a specific color
        and then reflecting that to the pen. I was able to solve this through trial and error where I would put in an x and y
        coordinate I thought would work then tested it and then adjusted if it didn't work. Through this process I was eventually
        able to get the correct colors to correspond when a user clicks on a specific color. </p>

      <p> Another problem I encountered was that in my popup.html, when the user selected a time it wasn't saving
        that variable and allowing for me to use it in index.js for my drawing game. I was able to get a lot of support
        from Raina in which she directed me to session storage which we were able to implement and that solved the issue I was having.
        By saving my variable to the session I could use it in my index.js file.
      </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future Work </h2>
      <p> Additional ideas and features I might like to add to my site in the future: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Purchase and connect a custom domain</li>
        <li>Adding more colors and features that would relate to my branding</li>
        <li>Make navigation easier with dropdown and projects to look at when in a writeup or another project</li>
      </ul>
